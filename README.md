# OpenGLReference
Personal reference code for OpenGL

This repository contains my own implementation of the application created in the first part of [https://learnopengl.com/](https://learnopengl.com/), complete with wrappers/abstractions for most of the used library components and dependencies managed exclusively by vcpkg + cmake.

This is intended for my own reference as I make further use of OpenGL and for ease of sharing details with others.
